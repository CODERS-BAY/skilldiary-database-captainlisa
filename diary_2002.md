* There are weak and strong entities. a weak entity cannot exist without a strong entity, e.g. a house (strong entity) can exist without rooms, but a roome (weak entity) cannot exist without a house
* it is not possible to portray an N:M relation, so these relationships are presented in an associative table. 
* If you put a foreign key as an attribute to an entity you **need** a relationship between said entity and the foreign key.
